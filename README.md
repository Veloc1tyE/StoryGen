# StoryGen
Evermore is a short story I wrote last year. Using an LSTM network, I attempted to train an AI to write stories like me - That way I can enslave an AI to write my stories for me! 

In all honestly, the tool is pretty cool, and it's a nice little introduction to LSTMs, but it isn't going to write anything spectacular, at least not without lots and lots of training data.
